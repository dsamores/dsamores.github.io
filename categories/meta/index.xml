&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="why-start-a-blog">Why Start a Blog?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over the years, I’ve spent a lot of time building data pipelines, wrestling with concurrency bugs, and learning (the hard way) how a small schema change can ripple through a system and break things in unexpected ways. Along the way, I’ve learned a lot—some about tools and architecture, others about the hidden pitfalls engineers run into when systems grow more complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until now, most of those insights have stayed buried in internal docs or my own memory. This blog is my way of bringing them together—not just for others, but for myself too. It’s part shared notebook, part personal reference guide: a place to record the patterns, solutions, and configurations I keep running into like waking up in Punxsutawney, over and over again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll share my experiences and opinions—the solid solutions, the last-minute fixes that saved me, and the moments that taught me more than I expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="why-now">Why Now?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In 2025, tech is moving faster than ever. AI is generating articles, documentation, and even code at an incredible pace. That’s impressive—and useful—but it also makes me want to offer something different: a human voice. My focus will be on sharing real experiences, giving opinions shaped by my own context, and doing data analysis grounded in how I see the world. These are the kinds of things AI can’t do (at least, not yet).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also feels like the right moment in my life to pause and reflect. After years of working on projects of all shapes and sizes—across different industries, teams, and stacks—I finally feel like I’ve seen enough to start comparing, sharing patterns, and connecting ideas that have stuck with me. This blog isn’t about prescriptive advice or step-by-step tutorials. It’s about my take on things: what worked, what didn’t, and the good, the bad, and the ugly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s still plenty I don’t know, and that’s part of the appeal. This isn’t about tying everything up in neat conclusions—it’s about exploring ideas, asking questions, and learning out loud.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="what-ill-write-about">What I’ll Write About
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This won’t be a blog full of step-by-step how‑tos or “10x developer hacks.” Instead, it’ll focus on the kinds of questions and challenges I keep coming back to—and some of the things I’ve been working on recently:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Systems and Data Engineering&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Designing resilient pipelines, handling schema changes, and keeping systems running smoothly under real-world pressures—without unexpected wake-up calls at odd hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tool Experiments&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Trying out frameworks, comparing trade-offs, and sharing why certain technologies worked (or didn’t) in specific contexts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Data Analysis&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Exploring interesting datasets—ones that feel relevant to me but that I hope will spark curiosity in a wider audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>AI in Practice&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The different ways I’m using AI in my everyday work—from automating repetitive tasks to experimenting with large language models—and where I think a human perspective still matters most.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Developer Tools and Craft&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Testing strategies, clean code, and workflows that make engineering work more productive (and a little less frustrating).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Rather than trying to be exhaustive or prescriptive, I’ll focus on perspective: my take on the patterns, trade-offs, and lessons that have shaped how I approach engineering. Some of it might feel like solid engineering advice; some of it might feel more like untangling Inception-level layers of complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="where-this-might-go">Where This Might Go
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I don’t know exactly where this blog will lead, and that’s part of the appeal. At the very least, it’ll be a place for me to think out loud, document what I’m learning, and explore ideas I haven’t fully figured out yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If any of it resonates—whether it sparks a new idea, helps avoid a pitfall, or just makes you nod in recognition—that’s a bonus.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
