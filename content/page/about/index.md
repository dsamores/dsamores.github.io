# 👋 Hi, I’m David

Hi! I’m David Amores – a data and software engineer who loves building systems, experimenting with new technologies, and sharing what I learn.  

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I write about:  
- 🛠 **Data Engineering & Infrastructure**  
- 🚀 **Programming tips (Python, Go, Rust, etc.)**  
- 📝 **My experiences in tech and career lessons**

You’ll also occasionally find personal reflections and side projects I’m working on.
